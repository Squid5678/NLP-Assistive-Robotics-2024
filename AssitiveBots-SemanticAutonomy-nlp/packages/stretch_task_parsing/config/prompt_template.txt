First I am providing the domain definition of the robotic task with pick-n-place and navigation:
domain_definition
Then here is one example of problem definition which misses goal specification:
(define (problem pick_place_scenario)
    (:domain pick_and_place_nav)
    (:objects 
        apple - object
        basket - object
        robo - robot
    )

    (:init 
        (GRASPABLE apple)
        (CONTAINABLE basket)
        (free robo)
    )
)
Your job is to extract the definition of goal specification based on human instruction. 
For example, the human instruction is "move the apple in the fridge to the basket on the dining_table". 
The extracted goal specification should be the following:
(:goal 
    (contain apple basket)
)
Now for the test case, the problem definition is:
test_problem_definition
The human instruction is "test_human_instruction".
Provide me with the corresponding goal specification without any other text.
